Completed a summer research internship with the Audio Spatialization Laboratory at the Qualcomm Institute. I contributed personalized HRTF modeling features to the Space3D virtual acoustics platform and built a Blender-based pipeline for generating evaluation meshes from 2D portrait photos.

During the internship I:

- prototyped CUDA kernels that accelerate acoustic ray tracing for reflective VR environments;
- validated spatial audio realism with internal listening studies and sensor measurements;
- collaborated with researchers to integrate the new personalization workflow into the production release plan.

Many thanks to Prof. Shahrokh Yadegari and the Space3D team for the mentorship!
