As the 2024 President of UC San Diego GradWIC, I kicked off our new mentorship circles that connect incoming graduate women with senior mentors across ECE and CSE. We welcomed more than 60 mentees in the first cohort and rolled out a quarterly technical workshop series focused on signal processing, AR/VR, and applied machine learning careers.

Key program highlights:

- built an opt-in matching platform that pairs mentees by research interests and preferred communication style;
- secured sponsorship from campus partners to fund childcare grants and conference travel micro-awards;
- collaborated with industry speakers from Qualcomm and Adobe to lead our opening workshop on inclusive XR research.
