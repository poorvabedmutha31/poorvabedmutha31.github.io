Our WellComp workshop paper *"Privacy-Aware Respiratory Symptom Detection in-the-Wild"* received the **Best Paper Award** at ACM UbiComp/ISWC 2023. Huge thanks to my co-authors Manas Bedmutha and Prof. Nadir Weibel for the collaboration!

Highlights from the project:

- designed a privacy-preserving data collection pipeline for cough and sneeze detection in uncontrolled environments;
- demonstrated that signal processing features at 1 kHz sampling still enable robust classification;
- released an open, reproducible workflow for low-resource respiratory monitoring studies.

We are currently preparing an extended journal versionâ€”reach out if you would like to collaborate or evaluate the pipeline in your deployment!
