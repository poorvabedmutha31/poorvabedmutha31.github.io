## Description
PulsePal is a design-prototype for a wearable device aimed at early heart-attack prediction by tracking multiple physiological signals and deriving risk indicators through lightweight on-device analysis.

## Contributions
- Led rapid prototyping and HCI-driven iterations informed by human-centered design principles.
- Integrated multiple vitals streams (ECG, PPG proxies) and designed UX flows for emergency escalation and clinician review.
