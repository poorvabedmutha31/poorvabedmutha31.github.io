      ### Poorva S. Bedmutha

      I am a PhD candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California San Diego, where I investigate human-centered virtual reality analytics, social signal processing, and physiological sensing for wellbeing. My research in the Cosman Lab develops immersive VR interview platforms, gaze calibration methods, and anomaly detection pipelines that support neurodivergent communication.

      Beyond research, I serve the UCSD community as President of the CSE Society for Graduate Women in Computing (GradWIC), an elected representative on the ECE Graduate Student Council, and a Graduate Student Senate member. I am passionate about inclusive mentoring ecosystems, leading GradWIC mentorship circles that connect more than 40 mentees with supportive advisors.

      Previously, I designed privacy-aware health sensing systems that won the ACM UbiComp/ISWC WellComp Best Paper Award (2023) and led data science teams at UCSD Health and Omdena. I enjoy collaborating across academia and industry to create accessible, ethical technologies for healthcare and mixed reality experiences.
