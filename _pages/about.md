I am a PhD student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at UC San Diego, where I build human-centered analytics for immersive and assistive technologies. Working with Prof. Pamela Cosman, I study how gaze, head motion, speech, and physiological signals reveal attention and comfort in triadic VR interviews designed for neurodivergent participants. My goal is to translate these multimodal insights into equitable wellbeing tools that adapt to the people using them.

Currently, I am:

- Designing VR analysis pipelines that align gaze sequences, audio cues, and joint attention to flag moments where autistic candidates may need interviewer support.
- Prototyping PulsePal, a conversational biofeedback coach that pairs pulse oximeter feedback with generative guidance to reduce stress prior to interviews.
- Serving as Junior Data Scientist at UCSD Health to deploy a recommendation API that connects students with mental health services and campus programming.

Previously, I developed personalized HRTFs with the Qualcomm Institute’s Audio Spatialization Lab, created respirator-free cough monitoring systems that earned the ACM UbiComp/ISWC WellComp Best Paper Award, and led canonical correlation analyses that linked music features with neural entrainment at IIT Gandhinagar.

Through service, I founded the GradWIC mentorship circles at UCSD (now supporting 40+ mentees), review for IEEE ISMAR and CHI LBW, and organize community-building programming for ECE graduate students.
