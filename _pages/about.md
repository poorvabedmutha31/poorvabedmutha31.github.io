I am a Masterâ€™s student in the ECE department at UCSD, focusing on Signal Processing and Mental Health. I am excited to combine these domains to develop human-centered artificial intelligence and virtual reality systems to support affected populations. Over the years, I have worked on developing a grasp of the fundamentals of these areas and have wandered on varied paths during my research journey.
