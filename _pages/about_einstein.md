I am Poorva Bedmutha, a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UC San Diego. My research spans social signal processing, virtual reality analytics, and physiological sensing for neurodivergent support. I collaborate with Pamela Cosman and partners at UCSD Health to translate multimodal measurements—gaze, pulse oximetry, posture, voice—into accessible wellbeing tooling.

Across academia and industry labs I have:

- **Mapped joint attention in VR** by synchronizing head pose, gaze, and conversational cues to surface coaching moments for autistic job candidates.
- **Delivered wellbeing recommender systems** that personalize health resources for students based on interaction data and opt-in feedback.
- **Earned an ACM UbiComp/ISWC WellComp Best Paper Award** for low-sampling respiratory symptom detection that preserves privacy on mobile devices.
- **Collaborated with the Qualcomm Institute** to generate individualized HRTFs with immersive ray-tracing pipelines for spatial audio companionship.

When I am not in the lab, you will find me building mentorship communities for Graduate Women in Computing (GradWIC) and experimenting with new sourdough recipes to share at group meetings.

Let’s connect if you are exploring inclusive VR, digital wellbeing, or creative uses of physiological signals.
